1. Project Overview
	Vejori Restaurant is a website project showing the menu, location, and services of the restaurant our group decided to work on. It shows information about the 	restaurant, like the meals, drinks, snacks, and breakfast options all shown for in the menu section which the user is able to navigate freely, the locations 	and about us sections. 

2. The file Structures (The html and CSS files)
The Main HTML Pages:
	•index.html: This is the homepage of the Vejori restaurant website. It displays the landing page, a brief section of About us, the locations and contact us 	information in the footer.
	•about-us.html: Contains information about the restaurant, its history, the mission and the development team.
	•breakfastmenu.html: Lists breakfast items available at the restaurant.
	•drinks.html: Lists drinks offered at the restaurant.
	•meals.html: It lists all meals for lunch and dinner offered at Vejori restaurant.
	•menu.html: Provides a list of all food items in 4 divided sections of breakfast, meals, drinks and snacks.
	•nav.html: Contains navigation components, allowing for easy updating across pages. (We were not able to integrate it properly into the other pages)
	•snacks.html: Showcases available snacks.

3. HTML Files
Each HTML file corresponds to a specific section of the website:
	•index.html: Serves as the homepage/ landing page, welcoming users and providing a button to explore the restaurant’s menu and services.
	•about-us.html: It displays the details of the restaurant's background, the values, and the mission.
	•Menu Pages (breakfastmenu.html, drinks.html, meals.html, snacks.html): Each html page displays information on the respective category, showing images and 	descriptions for each item on the menu.
	•menu.html: This acts as a central menu showing the 4 different categories of meals which further describe all the items in the menu.
	•nav.html: This contains the site's navigation bar to simplify updates and ensure consistent navigation throughout all the pages (We failed to implement this 	successfully into the other html files).

4. CSS Files
Each HTML file has a corresponding CSS file to handle its unique styling:
	•style.css: Provides styling for index.html and other html pages like fonts, colours, and layout basics.
	•menu.css: Provides styling for the menu.html page and acts as a basis for providing the nav for the rest of the other pages excluding the home page 	(index.html) which does not have a nav section to navigate other pages.
	•breakfastmenu.css, meals.css, drinks.css, snacks.css: All these provide styling to breakfastmenu.html, meals.html, drinks.html, snacks.html respectively.
